# tennis_scoring_challenge
This is a Tennis scoring system. 16 test cases were written and passed to ensure that 
the rules for the set scoring(including the tiebreaker rule) and the game scoring are correct.

Future plans of improvement are but are not limited to: 

Must

Add input validation, error handling, and error trapping.
Test coverage must include all the members and methods in all the classes.
Add base classes to clearly define the public interface and methods signature.
Display the status of the Set scoring
Eliminate object creation inside a concrete class specifically inside the Match class to decouple classes from each other( consider object creation pattern)

Could

Add user interface
Add controller

Should

Write in a different programming language
